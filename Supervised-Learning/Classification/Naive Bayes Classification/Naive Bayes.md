# Naive Bayes Classification

Naive Bayes classification algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem, used for classification tasks in machine learning. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent, which simplifies the calculation of probabilities and makes it efficient for high-dimensional data.
