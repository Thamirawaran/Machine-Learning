# Linear Rgression 
Equation $Y = mX + C $
Here, $Y$ = Target/ Ground truths
      $X$ = Features

# Multiple Linear Regression
Equation $Y = m_1X_1 + m_2X_2 + ... + C $
Here, $X_1, X_2$ are coefficients of features

# Polynomial Regression
Equation $Y = m_1X + m_2X^2 + C$
Here, $m_1, m_2$ are coefficients of the first and second powers of the factor

# Performance Metrics
## Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
MAE= $\frac{1}{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x - y|}$
## Mean Squared Error (MSE)
## Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
## The Coefficient of Determination (R-squared)
